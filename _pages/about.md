I'm a 21 year old aspiring number theorist/geometer currently in his 2nd year of undergrad at [The Faculty of natural sciences at the University of Zagreb](https://www.pmf.unizg.hr/math/en). Previously I spent the 2022/2023 academic year at [UCSD](https://www.math.ucsd.edu/). In my spare time I enjoy playing [Osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/), bouldering, hiking as well as baking!

Academic Interests
======
My interests mainly lie in the field of arithmetic geometry, though a lot of different math is on my radar! Primarily I'm interested in Arakelov theory (the study of algebraic intersection theory on arithmetic surfaces embued with a hermitian metric) and more specifically the program of Kudla that seeks to relate special arithmetic cycles on Shimura varieties to certain derivatives and values of Eisenstein series and L-functions, but apart from that I am interested in p-adic geometry, geometric langlands and p-adic hodge theory.

My current pseudo-advisor and mentor is [Dalton Sakthivadivel](https://darsakthi.github.io/), together our work broadly studies geometric and topological phenomena in algebraic and arithmetic settings. Some topics we are currently working on include: Chern-Simons invariants of number fields, studying derived schemes and deformation problems, and studying connections on schemes in relation to Galois cohomology.
